# No evidence from MVPA for different processes underlying the N300 and N400 incongruity effects in object-scene processing

This repo contains the analysis code for the investigation of temporal dynamics of object-scene integration using MVPA. Our work focuses on the role of the N300/N400 complex in object perception.
