for different processes underlying the N300 and N400 incongruity effects in object-scene processing. *Neuropsychologia, 120*, 9-17. https://doi.org/10.1016/J.NEUROPSYCHOLOGIA.2018.09.016 

### Highlights

* We demonstrate above chance decoding performance of object-scene violations.
* Early object-scene integration shares neural patterns with late stages.
* No evidence of different processes underlying the N300 and N400 effects.
* Context-sensitive processes interact with perceptual stages of object recognition.
